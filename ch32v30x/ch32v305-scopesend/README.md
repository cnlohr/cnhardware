To mod:

1. Add a 50k / 1k variable resistor to the 6-pin connector.  50k across the high voltage, 1k across the low voltage.
2. Remove R307
3. Remove C303
4. Solder to the RIGHT (output) side of those pads.

CONSIDER: remove the resistor connected to the output.

NOTE:
Deflection left-right: ~3 ohms, 1V p-p
Deflection top-bottom: ~13 ohms.  Outside pin is GND. Positive only. About 0 to 1.5V
